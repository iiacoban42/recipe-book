- 1 onion
- 2 cloves of garlic

## Directions

1. Dice and cook the onion in a pan with a drizzle of oil.
2. Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink.
3. Add the bell peppers and let it saute.
4. Move the mix to a pot and add the milk and the penne, stirring constantly to prevent the pasta from sticking.
